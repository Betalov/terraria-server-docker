# Terraria vanilla server


### General Config
- Have a `worlds` folder at the root of your directory structure (you can have it anywhere, but change the volume binds accordingly)
- Put your worlds in the worlds folder
- When you create a container, map the port to 7777 internally, ie.: 1234:7777 (then forward port to 1234 in this case)
- Add a volume for the worlds mounted inside the container:
`./worlds:/root/.local/share/Terraria/Worlds/`\
- You can create a new world or select different world (located in the world folder above) by starting a container and attaching to it
`docker attach <container-name>`
- press enter
- choose the options you wish

To dettach without stopping the container:
`ctrl+p ctrl+q`


### docker-compose.yml exemple:
```
version: '3'
services:
  terraria-server:
    image: iceoid/terraria-server:1.4.2.2
    container_name: terraria-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    ports:
      - 7779:7777
    volumes:
      - ./worlds:/root/.local/share/Terraria/Worlds/
    environment:
      - world=/root/.local/share/Terraria/Worlds/newworld.wld # Default is empty, so no world is loaded
      - maxplayers=8 # Default is 16
      - port=7777 # Default is 7777
      - password=newworld # Default is passworld
```


### environment variables (case-sensitive!):
| Env variable | Possible values (Default value) | Description | Example |
| :------------- | :----------: | :----------- | :----------- |
|  `world` | (*empty*) | Absolute path to your world | `world=/path/to/world_dir/` |
| `maxplayers` | 16 | The maximum number of players allowed |  `maxplayers=8` |
| `port` | 7777 | Port used internally by the terraria server | `port=8123` |
| `password` | *empty*  | Set a password for the server | `password=serverpassword` |
| `secure` | 1 | Option to prevent cheats. (1: no cheats or 0: cheats allowed) | `secure=0` |
|`motd` | (*empty*) | Set the server motto of the day text. | `motd=Welcome to my private server! :)` |
|`autocreate` | (*empty*) | Creates a world if none is found in the path specified by -world. World size is specified by: 1(small), 2(medium), and 3(large). | `autocreate=2` |
| `banlist` | (*empty*) | Specifies the location of the banlist. Defaults to "banlist.txt" in the working directory. (You need to add a volume bind accordingly) | `banlist=./banlist.txt ` |
-worldname <world name> - Sets the name of the world when using -autocreate.
-secure - Adds additional cheat protection to the server.
-noupnp - Disables automatic universal plug and play.
-steam - Enables Steam support.
-lobby friends / -lobby private - Allows only friends to join the server or sets it to private if Steam is enabled.
-ip <ip address> - Sets the IP address for the server to listen on
-forcepriority <priority> - Sets the process priority for this task. If this is used the "priority" setting below will be ignored.

### Important!
If the `world` variable is left empty or not included, the server will need to be initialized manually after the container is spun up. You will need to attach to the container and select/create a world and set the players number, port and password manually.

1. `docker attach <container name>`
2. press _*enter*_
3. Go through the options
4. Detach from the container by pressing _*ctrl+p*_ _*ctrl+q*_

Server config file
It is possible to start the dedicated server using a configuration file that enters the above parameters automatically. The config file must be called using the -config parameter. The file can have any name, but must be in the same folder as TerrariaServer.exe. If a server config file is defined and the file is not located during the server boot, then the server will ask the user to input the parameters as it would if run without a defined config file.

The following is a list of available config commands:

world=C:\Users\Defaults\My Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds\world1.wld - Load a world and automatically start the server.
autocreate=3 - Creates a new world if none is found. World size is specified by: 1(small), 2(medium), and 3(large).

Banning and un-banning
The command ban <player> will ban the indicated player from the server. A banned player, when they try to login, will be displayed the message:You are banned for [duration]: [reason]- [modname]. A banned player may then be un-banned by editing the file "banlist.txt," which is located in the Terraria folder. This document contains a list of all currently banned players. To un-ban a player, delete the player's name and IP address from the list.
